# API Gateway with Spring Cloud

At its heart, the Spring Cloud Gateway is a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client trying to reach a resource and the resource 
itself. The client has no idea it’s even communicating with a server. The reverse proxy takes care of capturing the client’s request and then calls the remote resource on the 
client’s behalf.
